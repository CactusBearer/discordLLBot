This discord chatbot was built to aid in organization of board games in a server I run in Java in December 2022. I added some additional chatting functions for it to feel more lively and responsive.

In July 2023, I rewrote the bot in Python, as a measure of practice and to utilize more flexible discord API libraries. I at this point added the ability for server members to asynchronously play one of our favorite card games, Love Letter. Over the next 6 months, this game would be refined from feedback, and has been played by server members over 150 times to date.
